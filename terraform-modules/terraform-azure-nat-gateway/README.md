# Azure NAT Gateway Terraform Module

This Terraform module provisions an **Azure NAT Gateway** with a public IP association and binds it to a subnet. This setup allows outbound internet access for resources in private subnets while preserving security and control.

---

## 📁 Module Structure

- `main.tf` – Provisions NAT Gateway and associates it with a public IP and subnet.
- `variables.tf` – Input variables for customization.
- `output.tf` – Outputs the NAT Gateway ID.
- `versions.tf` – Specifies required versions for Terraform and providers.

## 🚀 Usage

```hcl
module "nat_gateway" {
  source = "../terraform_modules/azure-nat-gateway"

  name                = "dhdp-nat-gateway"
  location            = "Canada Central"
  resource_group_name = "dhdp-lab-resource-group"
  public_ip_id        = azurerm_public_ip.nat.id
  subnet_id           = azurerm_subnet.private_subnet.id

  tags = {
    Environment = "QA"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}
````

Replace `source` with the correct relative path to this module in your repo.

## ✅ Requirements

* Terraform `>= 1.3.0`
* AzureRM Provider `~> 3.100`
* A public IP address and target subnet must exist prior to applying this module

---

## 🛡️ Best Practices

* Use NAT Gateway for outbound internet traffic in private subnets instead of public IPs on VMs.
* Combine with NSGs and route tables for fine-grained traffic control.
* Use tagging for cost management and environment tracking.
